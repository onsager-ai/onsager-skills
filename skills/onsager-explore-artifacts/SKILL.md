# onsager-explore-artifacts

Workflows produce **artifacts** — issues, PRs, agent sessions, deployments, anything with a lifecycle. This skill is the read-only browse surface: list the runs of a workflow, drill into one artifact. No mutations. If something failed and the user wants a fix, that's `onsager-triage-run`.

## When this skill triggers

Phrases that should route here:

- "show me the artifacts this workflow has produced"
- "list recent runs of the morning-digest workflow"
- "what's the state of artifact `art_…`?"
- "show me the metadata for run `<id>`"
- "what artifacts has my PR-review workflow created this week?"

If the user wants to fire a run, that's `onsager-run-workflow`. If they want to fix one that failed, that's `onsager-triage-run`.

## Operating procedure

### Step 1 — listing runs

`list_runs` returns the recent runs for a single workflow. One artifact == one run (per the workflow runtime), so the response is the artifact list with a derived `status`:

```json
{ "workflow_id": "wf_…", "limit": 50 }
```

`limit` is optional, defaults to 50, clamped to `[1, 500]`.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "runs": [
    {
      "id": "art_…",
      "workflow_id": "wf_…",
      "artifact_id": "art_…",
      "status": "passed" | "failed" | "blocked" | "pending",
      "current_stage_index": 2,
      "parked_reason": null | "external-check: no spec issue linked",
      "started_at": "2026-…",
      "updated_at": "2026-…"
    },
    …
  ]
}
```

`status` derivations:

- `passed` — artifact `state == 'released'` (every stage passed).
- `failed` — artifact `state == 'archived'` (cancelled or terminally failed).
- `blocked` — `workflow_parked_reason` is non-null (stuck at a gate).
- `pending` — anything else (in-flight).

Surface to the user as a table or a tight list. The dashboard's run-detail URL is `<portal-url>/runs/<artifact_id>` — link each row when you can.

### Step 2 — drilling into one artifact

`get_artifact` returns the full row for a single artifact:

```json
{ "artifact_id": "art_…" }
```

Response shape includes:

- `id`, `workspace_id`, `kind` (`github_issue` / `pull_request` / `code` / `document` / or a custom workspace-defined string — see [`onsager-artifact::Kind`](https://github.com/onsager-ai/onsager/blob/main/crates/onsager-artifact/src/artifact.rs)), `name`, `state` (one of `draft` / `in_progress` / `under_review` / `released` / `archived`).
- `owner`, `current_version`, `consumers` (downstream artifacts), `external_ref` (e.g. `github.com/org/repo/issues/42`).
- `workflow_id`, `current_stage_index`, `workflow_parked_reason`.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_observed_at`.

`external_ref` is the most useful field for surfacing to the user — if the artifact is a GitHub issue or PR, that's the link they actually want to click.

`consumers` is a JSON array of downstream artifact ids. If the user asks "what did this produce?", drill into each `consumer` with another `get_artifact` call. Don't fan out beyond two levels without asking — the consumer graph can be deep.

## Common shapes

### "What's running for workflow X right now?"

1. `list_runs { "workflow_id": "wf_…", "limit": 20 }`.
2. Filter client-side for `status == 'pending'` or `status == 'blocked'`.
3. Report.

### "Show me the last 5 runs of workflow X"

```json
{ "workflow_id": "wf_…", "limit": 5 }
```

### "What's the state of artifact `art_…`?"

```json
{ "artifact_id": "art_…" }
```

### "What did run `art_…` produce?"

1. `get_artifact { "artifact_id": "art_…" }`.
2. Read the `consumers` array.
3. For each entry, `get_artifact { "artifact_id": "<consumer_id>" }` and report the `kind` + `external_ref`.

## Failure modes to watch for

- **`NotFound: artifact `…` not found`** — typo in the id, or the artifact was hard-deleted (rare). Confirm the id with the user.
- **`NotFound: workflow `…` not found`** — typo in the workflow id. Use `list_workflows` (from `onsager-design-workflow`) to find the right one.
- **`Unauthorized`** — PAT doesn't have workspace access.
