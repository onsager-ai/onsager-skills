# railway-devops

One skill for the full Railway operator loop: **status → debug → fix → deploy → verify**. It wraps the `railway` CLI in a non-interactive, JSON-first style that an agent can drive without prompts, and it leans on `RAILWAY_TOKEN` from the environment instead of an interactive `railway login`.

This skill is **repo-agnostic**. It assumes the project is hosted on Railway (railway.com) and that a `RAILWAY_TOKEN` is exported in the environment. It makes no assumptions about the stack (Node, Python, Go, Docker, Nixpacks/Railpack — Railway's builder figures it out).

## When this skill triggers

Phrases that should route here:

- **Deploy / build**
  - "deploy this to railway"
  - "push to railway", "ship to railway", "railway up"
  - "build is failing on railway", "why did my build fail"
- **Logs / debugging**
  - "show me the railway logs", "tail the logs", "railway logs --since 1h"
  - "why is my service crashing on railway"
  - "show me the 500s on railway", "show http logs", "show slow requests"
  - "find the request id abc123 in railway logs"
- **Ops**
  - "redeploy on railway", "restart the api service", "roll back the last deploy"
  - "scale my railway service", "remove the latest deployment"
- **State / discovery**
  - "list my railway projects", "what services are in this project", "list deployments"
  - "what's the status of my railway project", "is my service healthy"
- **Variables**
  - "set a railway env var FOO=bar", "list railway variables", "delete a railway var"
- **Run / connect**
  - "run this script with railway production env", "open a shell with railway env"
  - "ssh into my railway service", "connect to my railway postgres / redis / mongo"
- **Metrics**
  - "what's the cpu/memory on railway", "is my service hitting limits"
  - "p95 latency on railway", "request rate on /api"

Skip when:

- The host is not Railway (Fly, Render, Vercel, AWS, …). This skill knows the `railway` CLI; it does not generalise.
- The fix is a code change with no operational lever — let the normal dev-process skills handle the code; come back here once it's time to deploy or read logs.

## Prerequisites

1. **CLI on PATH.** `which railway` should resolve. If not, install: `npm install -g @railway/cli` (or use the official installer at https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli). Minimum version: 4.x (this skill assumes the modern subcommand layout — `service list`, `deployment list`, `logs --filter`, `--json` on most commands).
2. **Auth via env var.** `echo "${RAILWAY_TOKEN:0:8}…"` should print a non-empty prefix. The CLI reads `RAILWAY_TOKEN` directly — **do not** run `railway login` in agent sessions. Two token shapes exist:
   - **Account / personal token** (created at https://railway.com/account/tokens) — works across every workspace, project, and environment the user has access to. Required for `railway list`, `railway link --workspace`, and any cross-project view.
   - **Project token** (created in a project's Settings → Tokens, scoped to one project+environment) — works for that single project/env. `railway list` and other workspace-level commands return `Unauthorized` with this kind; `railway status`, `railway logs`, `railway up`, `railway variable …` all work.
   First call that returns `Unauthorized` / `Invalid RAILWAY_TOKEN` is the signal to ask the user which shape they configured and whether they need to widen scope.
3. **No interactive prompts.** Always pass explicit `--project / --service / --environment` flags (and `--json`, `-y`, `--ci` where they exist) instead of relying on linked state. Linked state is a `.railway/` directory and survives across CLI calls, but in fresh agent sessions there is no link yet — set the scope every call until the user explicitly asks to link.

## Operating procedure

The skill is a small state machine. Pick the smallest entry point that answers the user's question; don't run discovery they didn't ask for.

```

### Step 1 — discover

Always start by capturing the IDs you need, so subsequent calls are explicit. Prefer JSON output for parsing.

```bash
# Workspace-wide view (requires an account token).
railway list --json

# A single project's structure (project token works here too if you pass --project).
railway status --json --project "$PROJECT_ID"

# Services and environments inside that project.
railway service list --json --project "$PROJECT_ID" --environment production
railway environment list --json --project "$PROJECT_ID"

# Deployments for a specific service (most recent first).
railway deployment list \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --service api \
  --environment production \
  --limit 20 --json
```

Capture from the JSON: project id, environment id/name (typically `production`, `staging`, plus PR preview envs), service ids/names, the latest deployment id and its `status` (`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `BUILDING`, `DEPLOYING`, `CRASHED`, `REMOVED`). The deployment status is what tells you whether the symptom is a build problem, a startup problem, or a steady-state runtime problem — pick the right log stream accordingly.

### Step 2 — debug (logs first)

Railway exposes three log streams. **Pick the one that matches the failure mode**; mixing them makes the tail unreadable.

| Stream | Flag | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy / runtime | `railway logs` (default) | The app is up but misbehaving, or it crashed after starting. |
| Build | `railway logs --build [DEPLOYMENT_ID]` | Deployment is `FAILED` and never reached runtime. |
| HTTP | `railway logs --http` | The symptom is a status code, a latency spike, a specific request. |

Default to **historical, non-streaming** queries in agent sessions — streaming hangs the shell. Any of `--lines`, `--since`, or `--until` disables streaming.

```bash
# Last 200 deploy log lines, JSON for parsing.
railway logs \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production \
  --lines 200 --json

# Build logs for the failed deployment specifically.
railway logs --build "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production \
  --lines 500

# Errors only in the last hour.
railway logs --since 1h --filter "@level:error" --lines 100 \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# All 5xx HTTP responses in the last 30 minutes.
railway logs --http --since 30m --status ">=500" --lines 200 \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production --json

# Slow GETs on a specific path.
railway logs --http --method GET --path /api/users \
  --filter "@totalDuration:>=1000" --lines 50 --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# Trace one request end-to-end.
railway logs --http --request-id "$REQUEST_ID" --lines 50 --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production
```

Filter syntax (Railway query language, also accepted in the dashboard):

- **Text**: bare words → substring match; `"two words"` → phrase.
- **Level** (deploy/build only): `@level:error`, `@level:warn`, `@level:info`.
- **HTTP fields**: `@httpStatus`, `@method`, `@path`, `@host`, `@requestId`, `@clientUa`, `@srcIp`, `@edgeRegion`, `@upstreamAddress`, `@upstreamProto`, `@downstreamProto`, `@responseDetails`, `@deploymentId`, `@deploymentInstanceId`, `@totalDuration`, `@responseTime`, `@upstreamRqDuration`, `@txBytes`, `@rxBytes`, `@upstreamErrors`.
- **Operators**: `> >= < <= ..` (range, e.g. `@httpStatus:200..299`); `AND`, `OR`, `-` (negation), parentheses.

If the user asks for "logs from the latest deployment even if it failed", add `--latest` — otherwise `railway logs` walks back to the most recent **successful** deployment, which is usually not what you want when debugging a regression.

### Step 3 — metrics (sanity check resource state)

Pair logs with metrics when the symptom could be a resource ceiling (OOM kills, CPU throttling, egress bursts, volume full).

```bash
# Compact summary for the linked service, last hour.
railway metrics --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# Specific dimensions.
railway metrics --cpu --memory --since 6h --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# HTTP percentiles + RPS for a path.
railway metrics --http --path /api/users --json --since 1h \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# Table across every service in the project.
railway metrics --all --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --environment production
```

Read these together with the deploy log: a memory line climbing into the service's limit followed by a sudden gap is an OOM; sustained CPU at 100% with growing p95 is a throttle. Don't editorialise beyond what the numbers show.

### Step 4 — variables (read-only first, write only on confirmation)

Variables are usually where misconfiguration hides. **Listing variables prints secret values** — treat the output as confidential, never echo raw values back into the chat, and use `--json` so you can summarise (key names + value lengths) instead of pasting plaintext secrets.

```bash
# Read — JSON includes raw values; redact before surfacing.
railway variable list --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# Write — explicit confirmation required before running.
railway variable set "FEATURE_FLAG=on" \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production
# Setting a variable triggers a redeploy by default; add --skip-deploys
# (top-level, before the subcommand) to set without redeploying.

# Delete.
railway variable delete FEATURE_FLAG \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production
```

Default to listing first ("here are the keys configured on production; which one do you want to change?") and only run `set` / `delete` after the user picks a target. For new secrets, prefer reading from stdin so the plaintext never enters the agent's argv buffer (visible in `ps`): pipe the value into `railway variable set --stdin KEY` (a top-level option on the legacy `variable` form; the modern flow is `railway variable set "KEY=$(< file)"` from a local file the user controls).

### Step 5 — fix and deploy

Three deploy verbs, in increasing order of intent:

| Verb | Effect | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `railway restart` | Restart the latest deployment without rebuilding. | Process is wedged but the build artefact is fine. |
| `railway redeploy` | Re-run the latest deployment (or `--from-source` to pull the newest commit / image). | A transient failure or you want to redeploy the *same* artefact. Use `--from-source` to pick up new commits without uploading. |
| `railway up` | Upload the current working directory and deploy it. | The fix is a code change in this repo. |

Non-interactive defaults:

```bash
# Restart (no rebuild). -y skips the confirmation dialog.
railway restart -y --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# Redeploy the latest deployment.
railway redeploy -y --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# Redeploy and pull the newest commit / image from the configured source.
railway redeploy -y --from-source --json \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# Upload and deploy this directory. --ci streams build logs only, then exits;
# perfect for agent sessions (no interactive log attach).
railway up --ci \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production \
  --message "fix: bump httpx to 0.27 to pick up TLS bug fix"

# Remove the most recent deployment (rollback to whatever was before it).
railway down -y \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production
```

`railway up --ci` is the agent-friendly form: it implies `CI=true`, streams build logs to stdout, and exits with non-zero on build failure. Without `--ci` the CLI tries to attach a live log pager; in an automation context that hangs.

After deploy, **always verify** by sampling the new deployment's logs and a tiny metrics window — don't just trust the exit code. The Railway build can succeed and the runtime can still crashloop on startup.

```bash
# Quick verification loop.
railway deployment list --json --limit 3 \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production
railway logs --lines 50 --since 2m \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production
```

### Step 6 — run, shell, ssh, db connect

For development workflows that need production env vars locally, or a shell on the live container:

```bash
# Run a one-shot command with the linked service's variables injected.
railway run --service api --environment production -- node scripts/migrate.js

# Open a subshell with the same env (interactive — only run when the user is at the terminal).
railway shell --service api --environment production --silent

# SSH into the running container of a service. -i picks an identity file if Railway
# can't find a usable key in ~/.ssh.
railway ssh \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production

# One-shot remote command (non-interactive).
railway ssh \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production \
  -- ls /app

# Open a database shell against a Railway-managed DB service.
railway connect postgres \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --environment production
```

`railway run env` and `railway run printenv` will print every secret variable for that service — treat the output as you would `railway variable list --json` and never paste it back.

## Common failure shapes

### `Unauthorized. Please check that your RAILWAY_TOKEN is valid`

Either no token, an expired one, or a **project-scoped** token being used against a workspace-level command (`railway list`, `railway link --workspace`). Ask the user which token shape they configured; if they need workspace-level commands, they need an account token from https://railway.com/account/tokens.

### Build `FAILED`, deploy log empty

The failure is in `--build` logs, not the default deploy stream:

```bash
railway logs --build "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --lines 500 \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api --environment production
```

If the deployment id is unknown, `railway deployment list --json --limit 5` gives you the most recent failed one.

### `CRASHED` deployment, deploy logs end with the start command

App is dying during startup. Read the tail of `railway logs --lines 200` for the actual exception. Common shapes:

- Missing env var (something like `KeyError: 'DATABASE_URL'` or `panic: required environment variable …`) → `railway variable list --json` to confirm, then `railway variable set …`.
- Port binding wrong — Railway sets `$PORT`; the service must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`, not a hardcoded port.
- DB connection refused — check the linked DB service is in the same environment and the private network DNS (e.g. `postgres.railway.internal`) is what the app expects.

### Build succeeds, runtime 502 / Bad Gateway from the edge

The app didn't bind to `$PORT` in time (default healthcheck window). Either the app is slow to start (raise `healthcheckTimeout` in `railway.json`/`railway.toml`, or fix the slow startup), or it's binding to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`. Cross-check with `railway logs --http --status 502 --lines 50` to confirm the edge is the source.

### Sudden OOM (`SIGKILL` / `out of memory`)

Pair the deploy log with `railway metrics --memory --since 30m --json`. If memory climbs into the service limit and the gap aligns with the kill, raise the service's memory cap (dashboard or `railway.json` `resources.memory`). Don't silently raise it without telling the user — call out that you saw the ceiling hit.

### `railway up` hangs in an agent session

You forgot `--ci`. The default mode attaches a live pager that doesn't exit. Kill it, re-run with `--ci`.

### Variable changes "didn't take effect"

`railway variable set` triggers a redeploy by default — but if `--skip-deploys` was passed, the variable is staged and the running deployment still has the old value. Either redeploy explicitly (`railway redeploy -y`) or rerun the set without `--skip-deploys`.

## Conventions

- **JSON-first.** Add `--json` to every command that supports it, and parse with `jq` rather than scraping human-readable output. Layouts change; the JSON keys are stable.
- **Explicit scope every call.** Pass `--project`, `--service`, `--environment` on every command in an agent session. Don't rely on `.railway/` linked state — it's invisible to the user and confusing when it drifts.
- **Non-streaming logs by default.** Always combine with `--lines`, `--since`, or `--until`. Streaming is for humans at a terminal, not agents.
- **Never paste secrets.** `railway variable list`, `railway run env`, and `railway shell` all surface plaintext secrets. Summarise (key names, value lengths) instead. If the user explicitly asks for a value, paste it in a code block and remind them it's a secret.
- **Confirm before destructive ops.** `railway down`, `railway restart`, `railway redeploy`, `railway variable delete`, `railway environment delete`, `railway volume delete`, `railway delete` (the project!) all change live state. Repeat the scope back to the user ("restart `api` in `production` of project `…`?") and wait for explicit confirmation, even if `-y` is technically available.
- **Verify after deploy.** Don't end on a `railway up --ci` success line. Pull the latest deployment's status and a 50-line log sample so the user sees the actual runtime state, not just the build outcome.
- **One failure mode per investigation.** Build vs. crashloop vs. 5xx vs. OOM are distinct shapes with distinct log streams. Don't blend their tails in one report.

- The repo's spec-driven dev-process skill — when the fix is a code change, not just an ops lever; that's where the spec / branch / PR loop lives. This skill picks up at the deploy step.
- `plan-dag` — when the operator question is really "what's still blocking the deploy?" rather than "deploy this thing".
- Railway's own AI surfaces — `railway agent -p "<question>"` runs an interactive assistant inside the CLI, and `railway mcp install` wires Railway's MCP server into Claude Code / Cursor / Codex. Useful as a fallback when this skill's scripted flow isn't enough, but they're not a substitute for the explicit JSON-first loop above — they're for exploratory questions, not for reproducible automation.
